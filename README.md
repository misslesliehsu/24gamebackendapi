DESCRIPTION:
"Let's Get 24" is an online, live, multiplayer card game where the objective is to be the first player to use arithmetic operations with four preset numbers and get the result 24.  Games have 10 rounds; each round awards points; the winner(s) is declared at the game's end.

This repository is the FRONT end.  The BACK end can be found here: https://github.com/misslesliehsu/24gameBACK
